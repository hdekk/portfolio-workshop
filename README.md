## GitHub
GitHub describes itself as "a development platform inspired by the way you work. From open source to business, you can host and review code, manage projects, and build software alongside 50 million developers." It integrates with git, a software tool that can be deployed by developers to manage and track changes in software development project. Because the platform allows documents to be created and edited through a web interface, knowledge of git is not required to make use of the platform.  
  
To get a sense of the variety of projects that are shared on GitHub, let's do a search for the term "genomics" and look at a few projects. 

## GitHub benefits

## Markdown
A basic requirement of using Github is familiarity with editing documents with MarkDown.
MarkDown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to create formatted documents using only plain text.
When these Markdown documents are saved in a GitHub repository, the platform will automatically render them with formatting.
