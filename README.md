## GitHub benefits

## Markdown
A basic requirement of using Github is familiarity with editing documents with MarkDown.
MarkDown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to create formatted documents using only plain text.
When these Markdown documents are saved in a GitHub repository, the platform will automatically render them with formatting.
