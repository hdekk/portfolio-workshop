# Workshop: Building a Professional Portfolio With GitHub
Prerequisites:
Participants will need a GitHub account.  

Description:  
This workshop will introduce strategies for using the GitHub platform to showcase an academic or professional project. Topics covered will include:

1. Introduction to GitHub
2. Benefits of GitHub Use
2. Editing with Markdown
3. Project Organization tips
4. Creating a Repository for a Project
4. Hands-on Exercise
5. Next Steps/Future Workshops

## GitHub
GitHub describes itself as "a development platform inspired by the way you work. From open source to business, you can host and review code, manage projects, and build software alongside 50 million developers." It integrates with git, a software tool that can be deployed by developers to manage and track changes in software development project. Because the platform allows documents to be created and edited through a web interface, knowledge of git is not required to make use of the platform.  
  
To get a sense of the variety of projects that are shared on GitHub, let's do a search for the term "genomics" and look at a few projects. 

## GitHub benefits
- de facto standard for sharing code
- incentive to learn and use git (and all of it's benefits)
- incentive to adopt good project organization practices
- facilitates collaboration
- facilitates code re-use and reproducibility
- provides metrics
- many value-added features like GitHub pages, GitHub projects, integration with popular collaboration tools like Slack. 

Footnote: also consider Bitbucket and GitLab which offer 

## Markdown
A basic requirement of using Github is familiarity with editing documents with MarkDown.
MarkDown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to create formatted documents using only plain text.
When these Markdown documents are saved in a GitHub repository, the platform will automatically render them with formatting.

This short tutorial will teach you the basics: https://www.markdowntutorial.com/

## Creating a repository
Use the pulldown next to the "+" on the top right corner of the screen. In addition to specifying a name, you have several options to consider. You may designate whether you want your repository to be public or private, whether you want to specify a particular license for your repository contents, and whether you want a README.md file created automatically. All of these can be changed later, so it isn't critical that you make up your mind immediately. 

## Exercise
This exercise uses a demo project from Project TIER. Download the files from here: https://www.projecttier.org/tier-protocol/demo-project/. We will discuss why the demo project is organized the way it is.

Unzip the file and copy them to a new GitHub repository. In order to create directories, you will need to create placeholder readme.md files, which I will demonstrate. When you use git locally, transferring a project to GitHub is automated and can be done from the command line, using a gui tool, or using built-in functionality in an IDE.

## Next Steps
Future workshops will focus on using git and building websites using GitHub pages. Are there other topics you areinterested in?
